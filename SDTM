1. sponsor --> drug to be sold --> fda --> approval needs --> safety and efficacy --> approve

2. to check the drugs--> clinical trials

3. subjects  --- investigators

4. prepare protocol and get approval from fda
5. selections (subjects & investigators)
6. cdm team (data entry (prepare crf) & data managers (validat and prepare rawdata)
7. biostats(prepares SAPs based on protocol), sas programmer prepares the reports on request of biostats.
8. medical writing team --> synopsys --> submits to biostats --- those people will submit csr to fda
